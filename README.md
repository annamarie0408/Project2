Project 2 – Chapter 9, Searching and Sorting Algorithms.

Read in the array from the data file of numbers, given in Moodle.

Part 1
Find the index of first instance of the number 976 using a linear search, this should be in a function
outside the “main” function.

Part 2
1. Sort the original array using bubble-sort; keep track of the number of swaps for display at the
end of the program.
2. Program a linear search on the bubble-sorted array, to find the first index of the number 976,
keep track of the index and the number of comparisons it makes to find the index for display at
the end of the program.

Part 3
1. Sort the original array using selection-sort; keep track of the number of swaps for display at the
end of the program.
2. Program a binary search on the array that was sorted using selection sort, to find the first index
of the number 976. Keep track of the number of comparisons it makes to display at the end of
your program.
3. These steps should be modularized into 2 or more functions. Consider how you might use by
value or by reference parameters to return the information needed from your functions.

Part 4
Display your output noting the following:
1. The index of the first instance of 976 in the original array unsorted.
2. The number of swaps it takes to bubble-sort the array, and the number of comparisons it takes
to find the number 976 in the bubble sorted array using a linear search.
3. The number of swaps it takes to selection-sort the array and the number of comparisons it takes
to find the number 976 in the selection-sorted array using a binary search.
4. This output should be modularized into its own function (can be more than one if you’d like but
does not need to be).
